# bmi-app

How to run the app:
1. Clone git repository
2. Edit server/app/config/db.config.js, change HOST, USER, and PASSWORD, according to your mysql local server
3. Open two command prompts. For the first one, change directory to server. And for the second one, change directory to client.
4. For server and client terminal, type 'npm start'.
5. Open 'localhost:8081' on browser.

Challenges during development:
1. Creating routes for each functionality as it is case-sensitive and with just one mistake, everything can be affected.
2. Trying to follow a template is also challenging because there are a lot of exports involved.
3. Naming variables is quite confusing also.
